Welcome to Caospy's documentation!
==================================

**Caospy**  is a Python package to analyze continuous dynamical systems and chaos.

.. note::
    You'll need a Python 3.9+ version to run Caospy.



Its utilities are:

-  Solve systems of ODEs.
-  Eigenvalues, eigenvectors and roots of equations.
-  Classification of fixed points in 1D and 2D.
-  Poincare maps.


Some well studied systems are available in the library, like Lorenz's system, the Logistic
equation, Duffing's system and the Rosslers-Chaos systems.

**Authors**:
Juan Colman, Sebasti√°n Bertolo.
