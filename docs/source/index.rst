Its utilities are:


-  Solve system of ODEs.
-  Classification of fixed points in 1D and 2D.
-  Poincare's maps.
-  Eigenvalues, eigenvectors and roots of equations.


It has implemented systems of ordinary differential equations wich are very popular, 
like Lorenz attractors, Rossler Chaos, Logistic equation and Duffing.
