Installation
============ 

Installing Caospy is pretty simple. Here are two ways to do it.


Installation with pip
----------------

Use the next command

.. code-block:: Python

Installation with source code
------------------------

If you can't install it via pip or you need to work with the source code use the following way. 

Caospy is an open source project, so you can clone the repo with:

.. code-block:: Python

     git clone https://github.com/Colman-Bertolo/Caospy 

Now you have a folder named "Caospy" in your machine. Enter the folder and run:

.. code-block:: Python

     pip install -e .
